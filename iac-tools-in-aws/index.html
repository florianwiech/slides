          <h1>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in AWS</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              When I first started with IaC there was the question which tool should I start with? Also, why do these
              many tools exist? Aren't they in general all the same? Shouldn't we keep the number of tooling as low as
              possible?
              <br />
              In next couple of minutes I want to introduce a couple of tools and compare them together. It is true that
              they all share the same foundation which classifies them as an Infrastructure as Code tools, and you can
              use them to deploy resources in AWS. But when we dive into the details you'll see that they do quite
              differ. And based on the workload or application you want to create, you can pick a tool that might give
              you a hard time achieving it that another tool can do for you right out of the box.

              Lay some groundwork adn then come to my favourite part which are some architecture discussion. We will
              look at some common resource types and how easy it is to create it with the various tools.

          <h3>Stack creation</h3>
          <img src="./assets/IaC-Basics-create-stack.png" alt="infrastructure as code create stack workflow" />

          <aside class="notes">
            <ol>
              <li>we have some kind of config file that describes the resources we want to create</li>
              <li>we run the deploy command from the IaC tool to create a collection of resources known as a stack</li>
              <li>
                the tool interprets the config file and creates a dependency tree (this has to be deployed before that
                and hey for this resource we need some info from another one)
              </li>
              <li>
                The IaC tool can not find a reference for that stack name, so it will create everything from scratch.
                Here it iterates over each resource and calls the corresponding AWS apis of each service to create the
                resource
              </li>
              <li>
                If it succeeds, AWS returns some information about the resource (eg.: identifier arn). the IaC tools
                will store the original config combines with the provided metadata in a state file
              </li>
              <li>
                If it fails it will stop the deployment and exit with showing the error message returned from the aws
                service
              </li>
            </ol>

          <h3>Stack update</h3>
          <aside class="notes">
            <ol>
              <li>We adapt our config file - change resources</li>
              <li>Running deploy again, the iac tool finds a corresponding stack</li>
              <li>
                It will calculate a diff to know what things should be changes. Based on the resource this means either
                just update a property or completely recreate the resource
              </li>
              <li></li>
