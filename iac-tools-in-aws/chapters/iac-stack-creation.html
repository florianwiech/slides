    <ol>
      <li>we have some kind of config file that describes the resources we want to create</li>
      <li>we run the deploy command from the IaC tool to create a collection of resources known as a stack</li>
      <li>
        the tool interprets the config file and creates a dependency tree (this has to be deployed before that and hey
        for this resource we need some info from another one)
      </li>
      <li>
        The IaC tool can not find a reference for that stack name, so it will create everything from scratch. Here it
        iterates over each resource and calls the corresponding AWS apis of each service to create the resource
      </li>
      <li>
        If it succeeds, AWS returns some information about the resource (eg.: identifier arn). the IaC tools will store
        the original config combines with the provided metadata in a state file
      </li>
      <li>
        If it fails it will stop the deployment and exit with showing the error message returned from the aws service
      </li>
