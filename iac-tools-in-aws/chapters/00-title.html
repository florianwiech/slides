    <p>
      When I first started with IaC there was the question which tool should I start with? Also, why do these many tools
      exist? Aren't they in general all the same? Shouldn't we keep the number of tooling as low as possible?
      <br />
      In next couple of minutes I want to introduce a couple of tools and compare them together. It is true that they
      all share the same foundation which classifies them as an Infrastructure as Code tools, and you can use them to
      deploy resources in AWS. But when we dive into the details you'll see that they do quite differ. And based on the
      workload or application you want to create, you can pick a tool that might give you a hard time achieving it that
      another tool can do for you right out of the box.
